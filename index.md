* Lab 1

    Lab 1 was my first ever time I coded and for a beginner I was pretty happy because hello world is a tradition of all coders. Actually coding it felt amazing and it felt like for the first time I was truly a computer science major. I was pretty happy about this code and it was the starting point of my career.
    
* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 1 was a favorite because it was one of ther first times I learned about indexes and how to convert the command line into arguments in order to use as input into the code. At first it was a little rough but over the semester I managed to get the hang of it but it was in this moment that I realized how much you can do with code. 

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 1 was a favorite because I was always curious about the high low game. It was difficult at first but once I got the hang of it, it was smooth sailing from there. It was one of the first times I tried to use an if statement and gained some basic understanding of what it meant to code.
